        <p>To Our Guests,</p>
        <p>Thank you for trusting us throughout this very challenging time. The Yogurt Brother's brand has been around for 8 years, and we truly value your loyalty and patronage. Our number one priority continues to be the health and well-being of our teams, guests and the neighborhoods we serve. To that end, I wanted to speak with you directly and share the precautionary steps we are taking to ensure a safe dining environment.</p>
        <p>Yogurt Brother's has always taken great pride in our exceptional food safety and service standards. In response to the threat of COVID-19, we are taking additional precautionary steps to enhance protections including:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Ramping up the frequency of cleaning, sanitizing and disinfecting services in restaurants including, frequently cleaning all high-touch surfaces and areas, such as doors, door handles, and seats, as well as frequent cleaning of restrooms throughout the day and a full cleaning of our restaurants each night.</li>
          <li>Educating our team members on preventative measures as provided by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), including heightened hand washing procedures and requiring team members who do not feel well to stay at home.</li>
          <li>Closely monitoring the situation and following guidance by the CDC to do all we can to protect our guests and team members and to help prevent the spread of the virus.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Though in-store dining is not currently permitted, we offer Yogurt Brother's Carside To Go where we'll bring a delicious treat directly to your car, as well as delivery through our delivery partners. We are continuing to work closely with our third-party delivery partners to ensure that food is delivered safely and promptly.</p>
        <p>Once again, thank you for being our loyal Yogurt Brother's guests. It is a genuine privilege to serve you and our neighborhoods.</p>
